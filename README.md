Design Patterns Practice in Java
Overview
This repository contains implementations of various design patterns using Java. Each design pattern is implemented as a separate lesson, focusing on practical examples and clear explanations to help developers understand the importance of these patterns in object-oriented programming.

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. These patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms and best practices. This repository aims to provide clear and concise examples of these patterns in action.

Repository Structure
The repository is organized into individual folders, each corresponding to a different design pattern. Each folder contains:

Java implementation of the design pattern.
A README.md file explaining the design pattern, its use cases, and how to run the code.
Design Patterns Included
Singleton Pattern: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
Factory Pattern: Provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects created.
Strategy Pattern: Enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime by encapsulating it in a class and making it interchangeable.
Observer Pattern: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.
Decorator Pattern: Adds functionality to an object dynamically without affecting other objects of the same class.
Adapter Pattern: Allows two incompatible interfaces to work together by providing a wrapper to convert one interface into another.
Facade Pattern: Provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, methods, or functions.
How to Use This Repository
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/MyasserSharaf1/DesignPatterns.git
Navigate to the desired design pattern:

Each design pattern is stored in its own folder (e.g., SingletonPattern, FactoryPattern).
Inside each folder, you'll find the implementation and the README.md with further details about that pattern.
Compile and run the code:

Navigate into the folder for the desired design pattern.
Compile the Java files using a Java compiler (e.g., javac).
Run the compiled .class files using java.
Example for Singleton Pattern:

bash
Copy code
cd SingletonPattern
javac SingletonPattern.java
java SingletonPattern
Technologies Used
Java: The programming language used for implementing the design patterns.
GitHub: For version control and sharing the project.
Markdown: For documentation and explanations.
