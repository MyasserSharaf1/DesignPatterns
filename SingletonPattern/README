# Singleton Design Pattern

## Overview
The **Singleton Pattern** ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This is useful in scenarios where a single instance of a class is required to coordinate actions across the system.

## Key Points
- Ensures that only one instance of a class is created.
- Provides a global access point to that instance.
- Used often for resource management, such as logging, configuration settings, etc.

## How to Run
1. Compile the `SingletonPattern.java`.
2. Run the class to see how the single instance is maintained throughout the execution.

## Example Use Cases
- Database connections
- Logger services
