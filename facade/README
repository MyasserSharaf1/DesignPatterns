# Facade Design Pattern

## Overview
The **Facade Pattern** provides a simplified interface to a complex system. It abstracts away the details of the subsystems and provides clients with a simple and unified interface to interact with.

## Key Points
- Simplifies the interface for clients.
- Reduces complexity by hiding the internal workings of subsystems.
- Useful when dealing with large systems with many interdependencies.

## How to Run
1. Compile the `FacadePattern.java`.
2. Run the class to see how a simplified interface interacts with complex subsystems.

## Example Use Cases
- Providing a simplified API for complex libraries.
- Interacting with large systems like a home theater or computer startup process.
