# Strategy Design Pattern

## Overview
The **Strategy Pattern** defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

## Key Points
- Encapsulates algorithms within classes.
- Promotes flexibility in choosing the best strategy/algorithm at runtime.
- Enables code that uses the strategy to be easily extended with new strategies without altering existing code.

## How to Run
1. Compile the `StrategyPattern.java`.
2. Run the class and switch between strategies to see the behavior change dynamically.

## Example Use Cases
- Payment methods in an e-commerce app (Credit Card, PayPal, etc.).
- Compression algorithms (ZIP, RAR, etc.).
